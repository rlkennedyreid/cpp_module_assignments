# shapes

Class heirarchy for shapes, as a demonstration of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

*Source.cpp* provides a demonstration of the heirarchy, all based on the abstract base class "Shape", which is used as an interface for various shapes, both 2D and 1D.

Inheritance is demonstrated through specialisation, such as the 'Square' class inheriting the 'Square' class.

Virtual functions are defined for accessing volumes, areas and other typical member variables.

## Key features:
  - Classes
    - Polymorphism
    - Inheritance
    - Encapsulation
