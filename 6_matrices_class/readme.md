## matrices_class

Implementation of a class for 2D matrices.

# Specification:
  - Member functions to show matrix info, such as number of rows, or value of specific elements
  - overloading of arithmetic operators to produce expected behaviour; matrix multiplication and addition etc.
  - overloading of () operator to provide element access
  - member functions to calculate matrix determinant using the recursive method of minors
  - explicit definitions for copy and move constructors, and assigment and move assigment operators

## Key features:
  - Classes:
    - operator overloading
    - copy and move constructors
    - assignment and move assignment
  - recursive algorithms
