#bohr_levels

Simple program to calculate the energy of an emitted photon between atomic energy levels and display it to the user.

Essentially a simple numerical calculation, given two numerical inputs.

Specification:
  - Calculate energy correctly in both Joules (J) and electron volts (eV)
  - Take user input
  - Implement so validation on numerical inputs

Specification was met.

I also implemented validation of general string inputs with a generalised method. Thus any specific string can be required from the user through simple changes.
