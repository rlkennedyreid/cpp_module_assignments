# cpp_module_assignments

My work from the course "Object-Orientated Programming in C++", taken in my third year at the university of manchester.

The module had 8 weekly assignments, that focused on specific features of C++, and a final project.

I received full marks in all the assignments, and acheived a first overall.

Things to note:
  - Work was required to be done on University machines in Visual Studio, so no access to version control during development!
  - Early assignments are based on basic features, so often quite 'primitive'; more functionalising needed etc.

See subdirectories for the specification of each assignment
